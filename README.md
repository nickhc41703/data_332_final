# Heart Disease Influences

## By Nick Camacho and Tommy Anderson

## Introduction
We decided to work on figuring out the variables that can influence the causation of heart disease because one of the members has experience with heart disease from an early on. The variables we looked at were smoking, BMI, physical activity, and age. We stepped outside the box and looked at external factors like location within the USA (County) and economic class (every 25% of the population in terms of income). During research, we found out that white people were recorded way more than the other races.

## datasets
-We found three datasets on Kaggle


## Data Summary
- There are total 225 cars, each student recorded 75 cars
- The lowest speed recorded is 10 miles/h
- The highest speed recorded is 38 miles/h
- The average speed recorded is 24.72 miles/h

- We decided to make a stacked bar chart and group the mph by every 5 miles for the x value and get the count of cars for the y value so that we can get a range of what mph range is most likely to slow down.
- The speed range that slowed down the most was 16 - 20 mph.
- It is important to note that the speed limit for that spot was 30 mph, and there were no cars that slowed down if they were going past the 30 mph speed limit
