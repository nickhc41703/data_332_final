# Heart Disease Influences

## By Nick Camacho and Tommy Anderson

## Introduction
We decided to work on figuring out the variables that can influence the causation of heart disease because one of the members has experience with heart disease from an early on. The variables we looked at were smoking, BMI, physical activity, and age. We stepped outside the box and looked at external factors like location within the USA (County) and economic class (every 25% of the population in terms of income). During research, we found out that white people were recorded way more than the other races.

## Datasets
-We found three datasets on Kaggle. We were only able to find similarities in the columns that said if they had a heart disease or not, their gender, and their age

## Scope
-Internal variables: smoking, BMI, physical activity, and age
External variables: location (County in the USA), economic class (every 25% of the population in terms of income)

## Requirements
-Combined table: heart disease, sex, age
Pivot tables: activity (BMI, physical activity, heart disease), substance (smoking, heart disease), state ( state, race/ethnicity)
Compare the proportions of each category and whether they had heart disease or not.
Making an interactive map showing the death rate and income of people within the USA

## Key Findings
Map: In the maps, we were able to find out that the southern areas usually lower income usually have a higher mortality rate from heart disease. This is shown in the 2 maps with deaths overlayed with income and the split on the 25 percentiles.

Gender/Age table: Men typically have a greater chance of having heart disease when they are 70-74 years old, and women have a greater chance when they are 80 years old or older.
Activity Table: Being physically active reduces the probability of having heart disease
Substance table: smoking increases the chances of having heart disease
We noticed that the difference between POC and White people who went to the hospital was drastic.
